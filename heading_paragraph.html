    <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</p><br>
    
    <p>Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single long illustration</p>
